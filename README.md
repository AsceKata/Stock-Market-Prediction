Time series data is utilized to predict the future trend. Stock price technique use machine learning 
algorithms to develop a sustainable model and see in the future course of the data. This project aims to 
develop a stock price prediction machine learning model and then deploy. There are 2 stages for this 
project. First a machine learning model is created for the time series data extracted from Yahoo 
Finance. Next, a web app is developed locally using pythonâ€™s Flask library.
